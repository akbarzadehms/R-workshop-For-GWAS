# R-workshop-For-GWAS
An introductory workshop to R and its application to GWAS analysis.
\normalsize{You are going to participate in a workshop of "GEMIRAN workshop series" which has been held by \textbf{IRGP team}. This workshop will be about \textbf{Elementary} \textbf{\textsf{R}} \textbf{programming} and its applications in genome wide association studies (GWAS). The main concentration of this workshop is on learning \textbf{\textsf{R}} more than GWAS. You have attended with us here to learn about using \textbf{\textsf{R}} for two days.\\ At the first day, instructors will speak about \textbf{\textsf{R}} environment and all fundamental requirements you will need for working with this application. \\Actually, the first day was designated for people who want to learn \textbf{\textsf{R}} for GENETICS data analysis. At the second day, you will learn about some packages which were released for GWAS analysis.}\\
Through the workshop you will be familiar with \textbf{simulated dataset} in which we run our examples on it. Here you can see a \textbf{small description about this dataset}:\\
We generated "RWdata.dat" via "sim100G" package in R software. "RWdata.dat" has 23 families with two offsprings, 92 subjects. The Genotype part of this data has 597 SNPs from 1000 genomes Phase III sequencing data VCF, chromosome 4, CEU samples. The phenotype part of this data contains age, hdl, weight, height, SBP, DBP, TG variables which used into examples of the booklet. 
You can download this data from \href{https://github.com/akbarzadehms/R-workshop-For-GWAS}{https://github.com/akbarzadehms/R-workshop-For-GWAS}. \\
